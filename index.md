## 7th Wosp-C 2022

The WOSP-C series of workshops on challenges in software performance has taken place at every ICPE except ICPE 2019 since ICPE 2015. It provides a forum for the discussion of emerging or unaddressed challenges in software and performance, including challenges in developing software to be performant, concurrent programming issues, performance and architecture, performance measurement, cloud performance, and testing. Its purpose was to open up new avenues of research on methods for software developers to address performance challenges. The software world is changing, and there are new challenges.

## Call for paper

WOSP-C provides a forum for discussing emerging or unaddressed challenges in software and performance, including challenges in developing software with good performance, concurrent programming issues, performance and architecture, performance measurement, cloud performance, and testing. The main areas of interest of the workshop do not change with respect to previous editions. However, the this year the call for papers will emphasize:

 - Software performance challenges in Empirical Software Performance Engineering (new)
 - Software performance challenges in Machine Learning (new)
 - Machine Learning challenges to Software Performance Engineering (new)
 - Software performance challenges in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and digitization processes
 - Open source challenges to performance
