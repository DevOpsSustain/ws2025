## 9th WOSP-C 2024

The Workshop on Challenges in Performance Methods for Software Development (WOSP-C) serves as a forum for discussions on novel and unresolved challenges in the field of software performance engineering.
The workshop encompasses topics such as performance assurance processes, the interplay between performance and software architecture, performance testing and debugging, and performance monitoring. The primary areas of interest for the workshop remain consistent with previous editions, but this edition scope will also extend to include additional novel topics.

## Call for paper

We welcome contributions that foster meaningful discussions on both foundational and novel topics within the performance engineering community.

This workshop edition will explore topics related to:

- Model-based performance analysis
- Empirical studies in performance engineering 
- Performance monitoring
- AIOps for performance assurance
- Performance testing and debugging
- Performance engineering in Agile/DevOps software processes
- Green software and energy efficiency
- Performance engineering for Machine Learning systems
- Machine learning for performance engineering tasks
- Industry reports on performance engineering challenges and experience

## Submission

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished papers that are not being considered in any other venue. Papers should be in the ACM format. They should describe research results, experience, visions or new initiatives. This year, we accept submissions as full (8 pages), short (4 pages), and vision or work-in-progress (2 pages) papers. Page limits include references. Papers should be submitted via Easychair at [EasyChair WOSP-C 2024](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icpe2024) (by selecting the "author" role, then "New Submission", and then the WOSP-C 2024 track).

ACM templates may be found [here](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). Presented papers will be published in the ICPE 2024 companion proceedings, which will be published by ACM and included in the ACM Digital Library. Authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism, as well as to the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions. Concurrent submission of the same work to ICPE 2024 and to WOSP-C or any other ICPE 2024 workshop is not permitted.

_By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy._

_Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper.  ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors.  The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022.  We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts._
