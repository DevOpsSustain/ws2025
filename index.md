## 9th WOSP-C 2024

The Workshop on Challenges in Performance Methods for Software Development (WOSP-C) serves as a forum for discussions on novel and unresolved challenges in the field of software performance engineering.
The workshop encompasses topics such as performance assurance processes, the interplay between performance and software architecture, performance testing and debugging, and performance monitoring. The primary areas of interest for the workshop remain consistent with previous editions, but this edition scope will also extend to include additional novel topics.

## Call for paper

We welcome contributions that foster meaningful discussions on both foundational and novel topics within the performance engineering community.

This workshop edition will explore topics related to:

- Model-based performance analysis
- Empirical studies in performance engineering 
- Performance monitoring
- AIOps for performance assurance
- Performance testing and debugging
- Performance engineering in Agile/DevOps software processes
- Green software and energy efficiency
- Performance engineering for Machine Learning systems
- Machine learning for Performance engineering tasks
- Industry reports on performance engineering challenges and experience
