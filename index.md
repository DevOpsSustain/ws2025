## 8th WOSP-C 2023

The WOSP-C series of workshops on challenges in software performance has taken place at every ICPE, except ICPE 2019, since ICPE 2015. It provides a forum for the discussion of emerging or unaddressed challenges in software and performance, including challenges in developing software to be performant, concurrent programming issues, performance and architecture, performance measurement, cloud performance, and testing. Its purpose is to open up new avenues for research on methods to address continuously emerging performance challenges. The software world is changing, and new challenges are to be expected.

## Submission

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished papers that are not being considered in any other venue. Papers should be in the ACM format. They should describe research results, experience, visions or new initiatives. This year, we accept submissions as full (8 pages), short (4 pages), and vision or work-in-progress (2 pages) papers. Page limits include references. Papers should be submitted via Easychair at

[EasyChair WOSP-C 2023](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icpe2023) <br />
(by selecting the "author" role, then "New Submission", and then the WOSP-C 2023 track)

ACM templates may be found [here](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). Presented papers will be published in the ICPE 2023 companion proceedings, which will be published by ACM and included in the ACM Digital Library. Authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism, as well as to the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions. Concurrent submission of the same work to ICPE 2023 and to WOSP-C or any other ICPE 2023 workshop is not permitted.

_By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy._

_Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper.  ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors.  The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022.  We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts._
